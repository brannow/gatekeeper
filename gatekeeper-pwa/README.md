## Quick Start

1. **Start Docker Container** (if not running):
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   docker exec gatekeeper-pwa npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash

   ```

3. **Configure Protocols**: 
   - Click the floating config button (⚙️) in the top-right corner to open configuration
   - **Alternative**: Use keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C (Cmd+C on Mac) to open configuration
   - **ESP32 Tab**: Enter HTTP endpoint (IP address/hostname and port)
   - **MQTT Tab**: Enter broker settings (host, port, credentials, SSL)
   - **Theme Tab**: Select theme preference (bright, dark, or system)
   - Use connection test buttons to verify settings before saving
   - Configurations save automatically to Local Storage

4. **PWA Installation**:

## Architecture Highlights

- **Hook-Based Architecture**: The primary architectural pattern. All business logic, state management, and service orchestration are handled by custom React Hooks. UI components are simple, presentational, and decoupled from the application's core logic.
- **Event System Fix**: **CRITICAL** - Resolved infinite re-render loops by moving event handling from components to hooks with proper memoization strategies.
- **Clean Architecture**: Types → Services → Hooks → Components → App. This is now even more true, with a clearer separation of concerns.
- **Adapter Chain Pattern**: Still used within the `NetworkService`, which is managed by the `useNetworkService` hook.
- **Composition of Hooks**: The main `useGatekeeper` hook composes multiple smaller, focused hooks (`useConfig`, `useReachability`, `useNetworkService`, `useStateMachine`) to build complex functionality from simple, reusable pieces.
- **Service Layer**: Services like `ConfigManager` and `ValidationService` remain, but are now primarily consumed by the hooks instead of directly by UI components.
- **PWA Integration**: Complete PWA implementation with InstallService, OfflineService, service worker, and cross-platform installation support.
- **ConfigButton Design**: Floating button with intelligent PWA state management and visual status indicators.
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and mobile optimization with iOS safe area handling.

## ESP32 Minimal API

Your ESP32 code needs a minimal HTTP endpoint:

```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <WebServer.h>

WebServer server(80);

void handleTrigger() {
  triggerRelay(); // Your existing relay logic
  server.send(200, "text/plain", "OK");
}

void setup() {
  server.on("/trigger", HTTP_POST, handleTrigger);
  server.enableCORS(true); // Allow web requests
  server.begin();
}
```

## Critical Bug Fix Summary

**INFINITE RE-RENDER LOOP RESOLUTION:**
The major architectural issue was resolved through comprehensive refactoring:

1. **Root Cause**: Event handlers in `TriggerButton` component were causing circular dependencies
2. **Solution**: Moved all event handling to `useGatekeeper` hook with proper memoization
3. **Implementation**: Used `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and refs to ensure stable object references
4. **Result**: Eliminated infinite re-renders while improving performance and maintainability

**Technical Details:**
- Delegate objects are now memoized with stable dependencies
- All handler functions use `useCallback` with proper dependency arrays  
- Timeout handling uses refs to break circular dependencies
- Service initialization moved to dedicated lifecycle hooks
- Components are now purely presentational and receive all data via props
